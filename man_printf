.SH NAME
_printf \- formmated output
.SH SYNOPSIS
_printf format [arguments ...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
The _printf function formats and prints its arguments according to the format, which can contain three types of characters: plain characters, escape characters, and format specifiers. 
Plain characters are printed to stdout as is. 
Escape characters are denoted with a backslash ("\\") and are converted to their corresponding special characters (newline, tab, etc.) by the compiler prior to printing. 
Format specifiers are denoted with a modulo sign ("%") which is followed by a character indicating how to print the corresponding argument (first specifier prints the first argument after format, second specifier prints the second argument after format, and so on).
.PP
Interpreted format specifiers are:
.PP
%c - arg is printed as char
.PP
%s - arg is printed as string
.PP
%d, %i - numeric arg is printed as an integer
.PP
%b - unsigned int arg is printed in binary
.PP
%u - int arg is printed as an unsigned int
.PP
%o - unsigned int arg is printed in base 8
.PP
%x, %X - unsigned int arg is printed in base 16 with lowercase and uppercase letter digits respectively
.PP
%r - print string arg in reverse
.PP
%R - print string arg in rot13
